# Project Overview

This project includes three Jupyter notebooks designed for data analysis, model building, and evaluation tasks. The structure and purpose of each notebook are detailed below:

## Notebook Summaries

### 1. a0_Utility_Functions.ipynb
This notebook contains frequently used functions organized as utility macros. These functions can be reused across different projects to streamline tasks such as data preprocessing, visualization, and performance evaluation.

### 2. a1_Exploratory_Analysis.ipynb
This notebook focuses on exploratory data analysis (EDA). It includes steps for loading data, cleaning, visualizing, and identifying patterns and trends in the dataset.

### 3. a2_Model_Building_Evaluation.ipynb
This notebook handles the process of building and evaluating machine learning models. It covers tasks like data splitting, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and performance evaluation.

---

## Requirements
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Required libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn

---

## Usage
1. Clone the repository.
2. Install dependencies using `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
